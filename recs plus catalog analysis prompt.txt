You are generating a Recs+ Product Catalog Validation Report from a CSV I upload.

Hard rules
- Use ONLY the uploaded CSV content. Do not guess. Do not use outside knowledge.
- If something is missing from the CSV, write “Not assessed”.
- Do not invent issues, counts, examples, or recommendations.
- Only treat rows as issues if any is true:
  - issue_flag_product_type_escaping = 1
  - issue_flag_multistring_misuse = 1
  - severity is HIGH or MEDIUM
- Treat RUN_SUMMARY.issue_reason as the completeness constraints for what was assessed.
- Treat all product identifiers (for example sample_product_id, id, item_group_id) as strings.
- Do not reformat, cast, abbreviate, or display product IDs using numeric or scientific notation.

Output required

Executive summary
- One short section at the very top.
- Audience is senior stakeholders.
- Include:
  - Retailer name.
  - Overall readiness status across all datasets:
    - READY
    - READY_WITH_FIXES
    - NOT_READY
  - A short list of cross-dataset issues.
- Cross-dataset issue rules:
  - Identify issues (by column_name and issue_reason) that appear in more than one dataset.
  - If the same issue appears in most datasets, explicitly call this out as a systemic issue.
  - Use plain language. Do not include examples, counts, or column-level detail.
  - If issues are isolated to a single dataset, say so.
- Do not mention type_guess, sample values, or schema details here.
- If no HIGH or MEDIUM issues exist across any dataset, clearly state that no blocking catalog issues were identified.

Internal report

- Retailer name and retailer_id.

- Run completeness
  - Repeat RUN_SUMMARY.issue_reason exactly.
  - Explain in plain language what was assessed and any limitations.

- Issues by dataset
  - For each dataset, list issue rows only.
  - Keep this section detailed and explicit.
  - For each issue, include exactly:
    - column_name
    - column_type
    - recommended_type
    - severity
    - issue_reason
    - type_guess and k
    - approx_distinct_values
    - sample_product_id
    - sample_value
    - longest_value_1, longest_value_2, longest_value_3
  - If column_type is empty, write:
    “Not assessed (schema type missing in output)”.

Client summary
- One short summary per dataset.
- Start with readiness_status.
- Describe only HIGH and MEDIUM issues, using the exact column names.
- End with next steps:
  - Ask for an updated sample feed with flagged fields corrected and schema types aligned to the product catalog specification.
  - State that custom fields can be multi-string, but the dataset schema must declare that type.
  - Recommend a short working session to confirm changes and plan the migration impact on live experiences.

Dataset summary table
- Place this section at the very end of the report.
- One row per DATASET_SUMMARY record.
- Columns:
  - dataset_name
  - readiness_status (use the severity value)
  - issue_summary (use issue_reason)

Style rules
- Short paragraphs and bullet points.
- Plain language.
- No emojis.
